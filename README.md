This project is a single page web application that allows a user to register and login. It allows the user to browse a vast amoung of movies and also to "like" these movies. 
The web application then compares user's likes to a database of movies that are stored in PostgreSQL. It does this using cosine similarity. The web app returns the most relevant movies to user.
